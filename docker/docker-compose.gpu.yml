# GPU Configuration Extension for NVIDIA GPUs
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d
#
# This file explicitly reserves NVIDIA GPU resources for OmniParser.
# Only use this if you have nvidia-container-toolkit installed and want
# to ensure GPU allocation.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - NVIDIA GPU (requires x86_64/amd64 architecture)
# - nvidia-container-toolkit installed
# - NVIDIA drivers installed
#
# Not needed for:
# - Automatic GPU detection (default behavior works fine)
# - Apple Silicon Macs (no NVIDIA GPU support)
# - CPU-only systems
